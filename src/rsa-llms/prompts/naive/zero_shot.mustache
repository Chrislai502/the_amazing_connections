Here it's the puzzle:There are 16 words, which form 4 groups of 4 words. Each group has some common theme that links the words.
You must use each of the 16 words, and use each word only once.
Each group of 4 words are linked together in some way.
The connection between words can be simple.
An example of a simple connection would be {"reason":'types of fish', "words":["Bass", "Flounder", "Salmon", "Trout"]}.
Categories can also be more complex, and require abstract or lateral thinking. An example of this type of connection would be {"reason": 'things that start with FIRE', "words": ['Ant', 'Drill', 'Island', 'Opal']}
The results should be in JSON format as following: {"groups": [{"reason":"reason why words are grouped", "words":["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4"]}, ...]}
Provide a full solution to the puzzle, it should be 4 groups of 4 words.
